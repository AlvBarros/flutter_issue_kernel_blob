This repo contains a simple Flutter counter hello world app, and a simple iOS Xcode project in which opens the FlutterEngine.

Hey all, I've been having some trouble embedding Flutter on a native iOS app. 
I've been following the [Add a Flutter screen to an iOS app documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/ios/add-flutter-screen?tab=engine-swiftui-tab), and the only time that it has worked is if I follow [Option B - Embed frameworks in xcode](https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/ios/project-setup#option-b---embed-frameworks-in-xcode), but specifically .xcframeworks that were generated in the *Debug* folder.

The entire error log message I get is as follows:
> 2023-09-03 10:57:39.771876-0300 HostApp[65357:3376845] Failed to find snapshot: /Users/alvarobarros/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/CB35362B-3FC7-49E1-9A48-F4BC55ADAD67/data/Containers/Bundle/Application/95711AB2-7B50-4E48-9BBB-2FCF32034F82/HostApp.app/Frameworks/App.framework/flutter_assets/kernel_blob.bin

And I get it, the *kernel_blob.bin* file contains Dart code that is used while running on JIT or Debug.
The issue is, I get this error log even when using both .xcframework files generated on *Release* folder.

And it makes sense - Release/App.xcframework should not have a kernel_blob.bin file. But then Release/Flutter.xcframework should not be looking for it.

Below is my `flutter doctor --verbose` output:

I'm using [fvm](https://fvm.app/) to manage different Flutter versions, but I have other people on my team that got this issue without FVM.

I have created [a repo](https://github.com/AlvBarros/flutter_issue_kernel_blob) for this issue. It contains a simple Flutter counter hello world app, and a simple iOS Xcode project in which opens the FlutterEngine.

If is there any more info needed, please let me know.

Thanks in advance!
